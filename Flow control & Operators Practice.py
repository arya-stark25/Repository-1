# 1.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than comparator

# 2.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than comparator

# 3.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than or equal to comparator
exp3= 4>=2
# 4.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than or equal to comparator
exp4= 5>=10
# 5.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than comparator

# 7.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than or equal to comparator
